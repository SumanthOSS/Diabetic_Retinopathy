# Diabetic_Retinopathy
Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using CNN Architectures


This project focuses on the automated classification of Diabetic Retinopathy severity levels (0–4) from retinal fundus images using deep learning techniques. Implemented and evaluated multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures — ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121 — to compare performance on medical image classification tasks.

Key Highlights:
- Achieved 70% accuracy with DenseNet, outperforming other models in multi-class classification.
- Used TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib for model development, training, and visualization.
- Addressed class imbalance and image preprocessing using data augmentation and normalization techniques.
- Evaluation based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix analysis.

Goal: Assist early diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy to support ophthalmologists and reduce blindness caused by late detection.
